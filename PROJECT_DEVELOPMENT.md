# Aim
The aim is to navigate around obstacles, pick up two uniquely idenitified boxes (Coloured red and yellow) and bring them back to the starting area.

# Key Functions
Key functions for the robot are:
* Able to navigate around the obstacles without touching them
* Not leave the mat
* Pickup the two coloured boxes
* Navigate back to the starting area

# Functional and Non-functional requirements

## Functional Requirements:
* Move forward until an object is detected in front of the robot (within 10cm) using the ultrasonic sensor then turn 10째 everytime until it no longer sees it, if the target isn't red or yellow (using the colour sensor)
* Move forward until one of the boxes (Red and Yellow) are found, then pick the boxes up using pincers attachment (using the motors)
* Turn 90째 when the edge of the mat is detected (using the colour sensor's reflection function to identify the difference between the floor and the mat)

## Non-functional requirements:
* The robot should stop immediately after detecting an obstacle
* The robot should not loop for a very long amount of time

# Use Cases
**Scenario: The robot encounters an obstacle**

>Inputs: The ultrasonic sensor detects an object within 10cm

>Actions: The robot stops and spins 10째 every time until it can not longer see the object to avoid it and continues moving forward

>Expected Outcome: The robot avoids the obstacles and continues moving

**Scenario: The robot must pick up a specific coloured object**

>Inputs: The colour sensor detects the correct coloured object to pickup

>Actions: The motor moves the pincer attachment into the correct object and picks it up

>Expected Outcome: The robot pickups up the correct object

**Scenario: The robot needs to go back to its original postion after picking up the correct objects**

>Inputs: When the robot picks up the correct object

>Actions: The robot should continue doing revolutions around the mat until it reaches the centre, which then moves backwards until the start position

>Expected Outcome: The robot is at its original position

# Test Cases
| Test Case | Input     | Expected Output   |
|---------- |---------- |----------------   |
|Avoid Obstacle|Ultrasonic Sensor detects object within 10cm|The robot stops and spins 10째 until it can no longer see the object and continues moving forward|
|Pickup specific coloured object|Colour sensor detects correct colour(s)|Using motors it grabs and picks up the correct object with the pincer attachment|
|Go back to original position|Motor picks up correct object|Robot continues moving forward x cm less every "revolution" until it is in the centre and moves back to the start position|
