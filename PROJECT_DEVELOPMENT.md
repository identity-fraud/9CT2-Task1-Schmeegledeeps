# Aim
The aim is to navigate around obstacles, pick up two uniquely idenitified boxes (Coloured red and yellow) and bring them back to the starting area.

# Key Functions
Key functions for the robot are:
* Able to navigate around the obstacles without touching them
* Not leave the mat
* Pickup the two coloured boxes
* Navigate back to the starting area

# Functional and Non-functional requirements

## Functional Requirements:
* Move forward until an object is detected in front of the robot (within 10cm) using the ultrasonic sensor then turn 90째 to avoid the obstacle
* Move forward until one of the boxes (Red and Yellow) are found, then pick the boxes up using pincers attachment (using the motors)
* Turn 90째 when the edge of the mat is detected (using the colour sensor's reflection function to identify the difference between the floor and the mat)

## Non-functional requirements:
* The robot should stop immediately after detecting an obstacle
* The robot should be quick at its speed and obstacle detection
* The robot should loop around the mat correctly

# Use Cases
**Scenario: The robot encounters an obstacle**

>Inputs: The ultrasonic sensor detects an object within 10cm

>Actions: The robot stops and spins 90째 and then continues moving forward

>Expected Outcome: The robot avoids the obstacles and continues moving

**Scenario: The robot must pick up a specific coloured object**

>Inputs: The colour sensor detects the correct coloured object to pickup

>Actions: The motor moves the pincer attachment into the correct object and picks it up

>Expected Outcome: The robot pickups up the correct object

**Scenario: The robot needs to go back to its original postion after picking up the correct objects**

>Inputs: When the robot picks up the correct object

>Actions: The robot should move until it finds the edge of the mat, then loops around the mat until it finds the blue line indicator at the start
>Expected Outcome: The robot is at its original position 

# Test Cases
| Test Case | Input     | Expected Output   |
|---------- |---------- |----------------   |
|Avoid Obstacle|Ultrasonic Sensor detects object within 10cm|The robot stops and spins 90째 and then continues moving forward|
|Pickup specific coloured object|Colour sensor detects correct colour(s)|Using motors it grabs and picks up the correct object with the pincer attachment|
|Go back to original position|Motor picks up correct object|Robot moves until it reaches the end of the mat, then loops around the mat until it finds the blue line indicator for the start |
